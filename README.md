Little utilities for managing files on the desktop.
Written in c and compile with gcc.

### HTML to PHP ###
This takes an html file and wraps every line in a `printf()` statement.
It goes without saying that there are better and more modern ways to mix code and output but sometimes it's just easier to get down and dirty.


### Convert to  ###
Runs through a text file and converts:
- CRLF to LF
- CR to LF

Because inconsistent line endings are just a pain in the ass.
